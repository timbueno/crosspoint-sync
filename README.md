# crosspoint-sync

A lightweight, self-hostable sync server for [CrossPoint / CrossInk](https://github.com) e-readers —
and any KOReader device.

- **100% KOSync-compatible.** Point stock KOReader or current CrossPoint firmware at it by changing
  only the sync-server URL. Same accounts, same auth, same endpoints as `sync.koreader.rocks`.
- **Better multi-device sync.** Progress is stored per device and the newest position wins, fixing
  the ping-pong you get with stock kosync servers.
- **Server-side service connectors.** Link services such as Hardcover, Micro.blog, and Audiobookshelf once; readers continue speaking standard KOSync while the server updates external reading state.
- **Lossless CrossPoint sync.** An extended API carries the full CrossPoint position (spine,
  paragraph, anchor, page hints), not just a lossy xpath + percentage.
- **Bookmarks, clippings, and reading stats.** Delta sync with tombstones for bookmarks and
  clippings; per-device reading-stats snapshots with a server-side combined view (streaks included).
- **One codebase, one runtime.** A single Node + SQLite server in one Docker image — the hosted
  service and self-hosted installs run the exact same thing. No native dependencies (uses Node's
  built-in `node:sqlite`).

The full wire contract is in [docs/API.md](docs/API.md).

## Run it

### Docker

```sh
docker run -d --name crosspoint-sync \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v crosspoint-data:/data \
  ghcr.io/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-sync:main
```

Or from a checkout: `docker compose up -d` uses the published image from
`docker-compose.yml`.

For local image builds from the checkout, use:

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build
```

### Railway (hosted-style deploy)

1. New project → Deploy from this repo (Railway detects the Dockerfile).
2. Attach a **volume** mounted at `/data`.
3. That's it — the server listens on Railway's `PORT` automatically.

### Bare Node (≥ 22.13)

```sh
npm ci && npm run build
DATABASE_PATH=./data/crosspoint.db PORT=8080 node dist/index.js
```

## Configuration

| Env var | Default | Meaning |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `PORT` | `8080` | Listen port |
| `DATABASE_PATH` | `/data/crosspoint.db` | SQLite file (parent dirs auto-created) |
| `REGISTRATION_DISABLED` | `false` | Set `true` to lock down a private instance |
| `AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` | `30` | Per-IP limit on registration (0 disables) |
| `TOKEN_ENC_KEY` | _(unset)_ | Enables external-service connectors. 64 hex chars, a base64 32-byte key, or a ≥32-char passphrase. Encrypts stored connector credentials at rest; unset = connectors disabled. |
| `TRUST_PROXY` | `false` | Set `true` only when direct access is blocked and a trusted reverse proxy overwrites any client-supplied `X-Forwarded-Proto`; permits connector linking through an HTTPS-terminating proxy. |

### Link Micro.blog

1. Sign in to [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/).
2. Open [Account → App tokens](https://micro.blog/account/apps).
3. Create a separate app token for **CrossPoint Sync**.
4. In CrossPoint Sync, open your account, choose **Micro.blog**, and paste the new token.

Treat the token like a password: Micro.blog app tokens have full account access. CrossPoint Sync
encrypts the token at rest using `TOKEN_ENC_KEY`.

## Point your reader at it

- **KOReader:** Tools → Progress sync → Custom sync server → `http://your-host:8080`
- **CrossPoint / CrossInk:** Settings → KOReader Sync → Sync Server URL

Create an account from the device (register via the sync settings), or:

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/users/create \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"username":"justin","password":"'"$(printf '%s' 'my-password' | md5sum | cut -d' ' -f1)"'"}'
```

(The `password` field is the MD5 of your password — that's the kosync protocol; the server stores
a salted PBKDF2 of it, never the raw value.)

## Development

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev        # tsx watch, http://localhost:8080 (set DATABASE_PATH=./data/dev.db)
npm test           # vitest: kosync compat suite + v1 API suite
scripts/curl-smoke.sh http://localhost:8080   # end-to-end smoke against a running server
```
